# Welcome to My Mobapp Studio

## Task
We are very pleased to hired as Junior Data Scientist here at My MobApp Studio. As I told you during your very first interview, data science is very new for us but you succeeded to convinced that it's one of the key factor to be successful in our digital world, as you said: data is life.

Last management meeting, we decided we will allocate resource to create a new mobile app and I have to say that I have already received multiple emails showing the enthusiasm from our employees who wants to be part of the team. We have all in-house the different skills we need to make this project a success (marketing, design, game design, software engineer)

Before moving forward, I will need a report on the market. In order to complete our portfolio, this new App will be first publish on the Google Play Store, so you can focus your research on it.

## Description
What is the size of the market? numbers of download and $
Same question but per category? (percentages please)
Depending on each category, what are the ratio of download per app?
Any additional information you will find useful for us to take the right decision.

## Installation
to install it follow this link: git@git.us.qwasar.io:my_mobapp_studio_194019_zhpqtr/my_mobapp_studio.git

## Usage
The code first loads the Google Play Store dataset into a pandas DataFrame and cleans it by converting columns like Installs, Price, and Reviews into numeric values, removing unwanted characters, and filling missing values. It then summarizes the dataset with basic info and category counts, helping you understand its structure. The code creates visualizations like histograms, scatter matrices, and correlation heatmaps to explore distributions and relationships between variables. Next, it performs category-level analysis, computing total installs, mean prices, and identifying the most expensive apps per category. For paid Family apps, it highlights the top apps by downloads and shows the distribution of genres. Finally, all results and plots can be interpreted to inform decisions for a new mobile app launch.
