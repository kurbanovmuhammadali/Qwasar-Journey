# Welcome to My Convex Optimization

## Task

One of the main challenges of Data Science and more specifically in Machine Learning is the performance measure. How to measure performance efficiently so that our model predictions meet the business objectives?

For example, let's pretend our goal is to classify fruits to know if a fruit is an apple, an orange, or something else, depending on some attributes (color, shape, weight...).


## Description
- def print_a_function(f, values)
It will plot the function with the values received as parameters.

- def find_root_bisection(f, min, max)
It will return the zero of a function using simple dichotomous algorithm between min and max for the function f.

- def find_root_newton_raphson(f, f_deriv)
It will return the zero of a function using the Newton-Raphson's method between min and max for the function f.

- def gradient_descent(f, f_prime, start, learning_rate = 0.1)
Write a simple gradient descent function which finds the minimum of a function f


## Installation
to install this project follow this link: git@git.us.qwasar.io:my_convex_optimization_192484_iyxsgg/my_convex_optimization.git

## Usage
The main code demonstrates how optimization works by finding where a function reaches its minimum using both numerical and algorithmic methods. It first finds roots of the derivative (using bisection and Newtonâ€“Raphson) and then applies gradient descent to iteratively move toward the minimum. Finally, it solves a linear optimization problem with the Simplex method to maximize a linear objective under given constraints.
