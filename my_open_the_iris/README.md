# Welcome to My Open The Iris
***

## Task
Introduction
Time do to an end-to-end project in data science. which means:

Loading the dataset.
Summarizing the dataset.
Visualizing the dataset.
Evaluating some algorithms.
Making some predictions.

## Description
Create two functions print_plot_univariate(dataset) and print_plot_multivariate(dataset). Each function will setup and show its corresponding plot.

Part IV
Create a function my_print_and_test_models(dataset), it will (in this order) DecisionTree, GaussianNB, KNeighbors, LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminant, and SVM

Remember to split your dataset in two: train and validation.



## Installation
to install this project you need to follow this link: git@git.us.qwasar.io:my_open_the_iris_192666_znhybb/my_open_the_iris.git

## Usage
This script performs a full data science workflow on the Iris dataset. It loads the data from a CSV file (`iris.csv`), summarizes it with statistics and class distributions, and visualizes it using histograms and scatter plots. Then, it splits the data into training and validation sets, trains six different machine learning models (like SVM, DecisionTree, etc.), and evaluates their accuracy using cross-validation. The output shows which model predicts the flower species most accurately based on sepal and petal measurements.
