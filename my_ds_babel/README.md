# Welcome to My Ds Babel
My Ds Babel is a data translation project built in Python. It converts information between CSV and SQLite database formats and helping data systems comunicate effectively. Simple, efficient and completely based on standard libraries.

## Task
The main problem is converting structured data between SQL database and CSV files without using external libraries. The challenge lies in handling various data types, column names, and ensuring correct formatting across different platforms.

## Description
This project solves the conversion challenge by implementing two main functions: csv_to_sql and sql_to_csv. They use Python’s built-in sqlite3 and csv modules to translate datasets efficiently between file formats while preserving structure and readability.

## Installation
No external dependencies are required. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. Then, clone or download the project folder. All scripts run directly using the Python interpreter — no npm, make, or additional setup needed.

## Usage
To convert data, run the project with your desired files. Example:
python my_ds_babel.py
The script reads CSV content, creates an SQLite database, and can also export database tables back into CSV files, enabling easy data format translation between systems.
