## Task
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language that's used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. Initially created in the 1970s, SQL is regularly used not only by database administrators, but also by developers writing data integration scripts and data analysts looking to set up and run analytical queries.

## Description
directors: id – this is a unique ID for each director dir_fname – this is the first name of the director dir_lname – this is the last name of the director

## Installation

## Usage
This query lists all movies for actors **who never acted between 1990–2000**. It joins `actors`, `movies_actors`, and `movies` to get names and titles. The `NOT EXISTS` subquery excludes any actor with a movie in 1990–2000. Finally, `ORDER BY` sorts results by first name, last name, and movie title.
