# Welcome to My Mr Clean
***

## Task
It is time to get our hands dirty and to manipulate some real world data. You have been hired by a new company named EncyclEarthpedia and your first task it build a search engine. EncyclEarthpedia is an online encyclopedia but specialized in the planet Earth, its geology, biology, and everything related to the Earth.

The search engine should be simple at first. The user needs to be able to type some words and the engine returns the most relevant articles.



## Description
First things first: Let's get the content of this article into code variables.

→ Use Wikipedia's API to retrieve the content of the article

Create a function get_content(article_name) to retrieve information about an article.

→ Using pip install wikipedia and import wikipedia is strictly forbidden!

## Installation
to install my prject you need to go with thi link:  git@git.us.qwasar.io:my_mr_clean_192176_e1acc3/my_mr_clean.git

## Usage

How it works (short)

Fetch article → get_content("Ozone_layer")

Extract & clean text → merge_contents() + clean_text()

Tokenize words → tokenize()

Lowercase & remove stop words → lower_collection() + remove_stop_words()

Count & display frequency → count_frequency() + print top 10 + plot_most_frequent()

to run it:

python my_mr_clean.py

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
