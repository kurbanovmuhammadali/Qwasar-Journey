# Welcome to My Linear Regression
***

## Task
Getting and analysing existing data is the very first task of a data scientist. The next step is to find tendencies and to generalize.

For example, let's say we want to know what a cat is. We can learn by heart some pictures of cats and then classify as cat animals that are similar to the pictures. We then need a way to "measure" similarity. This is called instance-based learning.



## Description
Plot the function f in 3D

→ Plot the progression of the gradient by using the history variable inside the class

We should clearly see the gradient moving toward the cavity of the function f !

→ How does the learning rate and the number of iterations influence the result 

## Installation
to install this project follow this link: git@git.us.qwasar.io:my_linear_regression_192485_2fwayk/my_linear_regression.git

## Usage
The code implements **linear regression**: `h` computes predictions as (y = X \cdot \theta), and `bias_column` adds a column of ones so the model includes a bias term ((\theta_0)). `LeastSquaresRegression` finds the best (\theta) using the **normal equation**, while `GradientDescentOptimizer` iteratively updates (\theta) to minimize a cost function. Together, they allow fitting a linear model and making predictions on new data.
