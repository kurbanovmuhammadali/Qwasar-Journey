# Welcome to My Readline
***

## Task
The function my_readline reads a line from the strean represented by fd and returns it into an allocated string (heap or stack ?). It stops when either the newline character is read or when the end-of-file is reached, whichever comes first. The newline character is not copied to the string.

On success, a pointer to the string is returned. On error, a null pointer is returned. If the end-of-file occurs before any characters have been read, the string remains unchanged.

Number of characters read will be set by the global variable READLINE_READ_SIZE You are allowed to maximum two global variables (one for your "storage" and one for READLINE_READ_SIZE). Be ready, we will change the value of READLINE_READ_SIZE.

## Description
In C programming, "readline" typically refers to the GNU Readline Library, a powerful library designed for reading lines of text from a terminal with advanced editing capabilities.


## Installation
you can install this project by this link: git@git.us.qwasar.io:my_readline_184762_c6jgem/my_readline.git

## Usage
For running code you have two variants:
1. Gandalf ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
2. 1:  open terminal
   2: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o test_reader my_readline.c
   3: Create a text file like file.txt (echo -e "Hello\nWorld\nThis is a test" > file.txt) - code for making this file
   4: ./test_reader

   DONT FORGET TO TAKE INT MAIN FROM COMMENTS )
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
